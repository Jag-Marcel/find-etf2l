# Find ETF2L
A simple extension that returns the ETF2L profile linked to a Steam profile.

Since the Steam API key is needed to fetch ids from custom URLs, you need to enter it when installing.
Otherwise, the extension only works on URLs without custom names. There are websites that can fetch the
ID for you, but afaik having to load them would be much slower than getting it from Steam directly. I
might add it as a fallback later though. It might also not be much of a bottleneck and I'm just stupid.
